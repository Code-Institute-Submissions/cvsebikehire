## Surface
### Colours
I chose to use two main colours throughout my website: a light grey (#646464) and a light green (#74C4A0).
These colours are based on CVS store. I wanted the website for the ebike hire business to match the theme of the village
store, to create a sense of continuity and to give the user a feel for the countryside they will be riding through.
I chose a background image of Cononley village, which compliments the colours of the site well. I have also used a
transparent white background behind elements to make the information easier to read for the user.

### Typography
For the menu, logo and larger headings I have used the font 'Dancing Script', as I feel this font encorporates nicely into 
the theme of the site and gives a very countryside, quaint feeling. For the informative text I have used 'Lato' font as this
is an easy to read font that works well with 'Dancing Script' and is easy to read at most sizes.

## Wireframes
I have included the wireframes for a desktop, ipad and mobile version of this site - [Click Here](https://github.com/natashacmyers/cvsebikehire/tree/master/assets/wireframes/)


## Features
### Existing Features
* This site was designed using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap frameworks.
* The homepage of this site inspires the user to hire e-bikes. The advertisement shows the extent of e-bikes and 
creates a positive impression, and the reviews show the user how reliable and friendly CVS store is. 
* The booking apge provides booking information, including pricing, available accessories and a booking form complete
with calendar.
* The contact page provides the user with further information including FAQs and a contact form for any other queries.
### Features Left to Implement
* A regularly updated 'updates' section, that includes popular routes, local pubs and inspiring photograph sites.
I would place this on the home page, as this feature would act as inspiration for users to book.
* I would like the confirmation pop ups to ONLY appear when the form is filled in corectly. This will require JS though.
