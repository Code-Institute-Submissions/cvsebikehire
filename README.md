General

- my site is bigger than the screen - why? 
    fixed with margins in the Footer


Heading 

- chosen the colour and font scheme relating to CVS store
- why does the padding in the header cause the right hand size of the header to have a margin that I can't get rid of?

Footer

- how do I make an email address open in their emails?
- small margin-bottom gap on footer - tried margin-bottom = -1px; nothing happened.
