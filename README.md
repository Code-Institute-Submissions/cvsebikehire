General

- my site is bigger than the screen - why? 
    fixed with margins in the Footer

- I want opacity in my background - how do I make it so that I don't have opacity in the rest of the screen    


Heading 

- chosen the colour and font scheme relating to CVS store
- why does the padding in the header cause the right hand size of the header to have a margin that I can't get rid of?

Footer

- how do I make an email address open in their emails?
- small margin-bottom gap on footer - tried margin-bottom = -1px; nothing happened.

Home Section

- Why is autoplay not working on the video? Tried ?autoplay=1 in address didnt work.

Bookings Section 

- why is is the opacity affecting the text and not just the background in the 'div backgound' class?
- why is the alignment all messed up on my contact page?
